## Auttonotech Landing (React + Vite)

This is a React + TypeScript single-page app that implements an Auttonotech-style landing page focused on **offshore operations for US mortgage, support, and cloud businesses**.

The project is structured like a standard Vite React/TypeScript app so you can extend it easily.

### Getting started

1. **Install dependencies**

   From the `auttonotech-landing` folder:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the dev server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Then open the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

3. **Build for production**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

### Tech stack

- **React 18** + **TypeScript**
- **Vite** for fast dev server & bundling

### Customization tips

- Edit the main page content in `src/App.tsx`.
- Global layout and visual system (colors, spacing, typography) live in `src/index.css`.
- You can easily:
  - Swap copy for your own positioning.
  - Adjust colors and gradients in the CSS variables at the top of `index.css`.
  - Add more sections or routes if you outgrow a single page.
